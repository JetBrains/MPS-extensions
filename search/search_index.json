You can write them like functions and call everything explicitly, or you can use forks. Forks basically allow you to write transformations similar to how you would do it in the MPS generator.</p> <p>In MPS, the unit of transformation is a model. You can\u2019t generate a single class (in case of baseLanguage code) inside a model,  and you can\u2019t generate classes from different models together. Shadow model forks can have any node as the root of the fork. If you decide to make a model the root of your fork, then you have the equivalent to MPS. But often the single root nodes inside the model are a better choice for the fork root. In case of baseLanguage classes, there\u2019s no difference if two classes are in the same or in different models.</p> <p>Forks also have support for mapping labels as you know them from MPS. They can only work if the map is filled before mappings are queried from them. Forks execute all transformations (which fill the map) before any reference is resolved (which queries mapping). As in MPS where mapping labels only work inside the same model, here they only work inside the same fork.</p> <p>Luckily, both have a solution for that. MPS introduced cross model generation where you define special checkpoints inside the generation plan. In shadow models you can define fork dependencies. If a transformation or mapping can\u2019t be found in the same fork, they are searched in all forks that are defined as a dependency. You can add dependencies in the upper part of any transformation that\u2019s part of the fork.</p> <p>As all transformations, forks are executed on demand. You don\u2019t have to take care of generating your models in the correct order. If you define a fork dependency, the transformation engine makes sure that the target fork exists when it\u2019s needed.</p> <p>A fork can specify a list of transformations that are automatically applied to the input, just like reduction rules in MPS. By default, there\u2019s only one attempt to apply transformations on all nodes that you copy using the <code>transform</code> keyword. If there are nodes in the output where one of the transformations was applicable, nothing would happen unless  you enable the fixpoint mode. Then the fork is applied again on the output of the previous execution. For performance reasons, a fork is by default not in fixpoint mode.</p> <p>The identity of a fork is composed of the fork name and the parameter values of the fork call. You can use this to create multiple copies of the same input node. Just add an extra (string) parameter to the fork and use a different value for each copy.

Be careful when choosing this approach as it can be slow when many events happen.
